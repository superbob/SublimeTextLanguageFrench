Q&A
---

**Q:** There is already a [Dictionaries package](https://github.com/SublimeText/Dictionaries "Dictionaries package") for Sublime Text, why another ?
**A:** Dictionaries is a really cool package, but it is big (26 dictionaries, 21 different languages), and all variants are not included for each language. I want to provide a package that has only one main language (fr_FR) with its technical variants. However I might ask to contribute to this project later, at least to add variants and keep it up-to-date. Currently, the French dictionary version included in Dictionaries package is : dicollecte Hunspell 4.5.

**Q:** Other languages ?
**A:** You are free to clone this repo, provide any language you wish and add your package to Sublime Package Control. If I'm not lazy enough, I might add one or two other languages, but not more.

**Q:** Can I contribute ?
**A:** If you want to add a newer version of the French dictionaries (fr_FR) you can submit a pull request. But I hope that I will be able to keep it up-to-date by myself.

**Q:** Why the fuck is all this not written in French ?!?
**A:** Even if I love the French language (my first language), I consider this page a little bit technical and I prefer to write technical stuff in English. Moreover I consider that people who want to add packages to Sublime Text are used to read English.
